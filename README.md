# Advent of Code 2024

Here are my solutions for the 2024 advent of code challenge.

My personal score: 41/50 ⭐️

## Rules that I followed

1) Absolutely no usage of LLMs for code generation or for ideation (used VIM to ensure I wasn't cheating at all)
2) Googling is only permitted when really stuck or obvious that a known algorithm is needed that I do not remember e.g. djikstra, bfs, etc. No code snippets are to be used.
3) Answer must be self-contained in a single .py file (no imports, helper functions, etc., every day is written from scratch (copy+pasting from other files is OK).

Note: This code is very messy. I optimized for solving the questions as fast as possible, and not much else
